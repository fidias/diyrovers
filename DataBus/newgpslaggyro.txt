New GPS / Gyro Lag Compensation
===============================

Previously a large history array stored every single piece of gyro and position
data. Lagged gyro data was put into the Kalman filter.  When GPS updates were
received, correction was with respect to a single gyro entry in the past. Then,
the heading error was applied to all gyro calculated headings to present, and
positions were each rotated by that amount.

Problems: In the current configuration, this process is the most time consuming
of the entire update routine. Rotation takes a lot of time. Also, storing
history for 100Hz sampling of gyro data requires a lot of memory because we
are storing all this:

    float x;        // x coordinate
    float y;        // y coordinate
    float hdg;      // heading
    float dist;     // distance
    float gyro;     // heading rate
    float dt;       // delta time
