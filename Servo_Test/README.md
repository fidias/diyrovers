Servo_Test

Code Sourcery g++ Lite toolchain, vanilla Eclipse.

Exported from mbed.org.

Includes Eclipse stuff, not sure if including .cproject, .project is the right way to do this.

So you'll need to install Eclipse, the ARM plugin and the Code Sourcery g++ Lite toolchain. And you'll probably have to
install some sort of flash utility like FlashMagic or CodeRed and use it's command line tool.
